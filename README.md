## Project Status

IPA is currently under development. The Android platform is incomplete, but is being actively worked on.

###### Looking for contributors to help with the Android templating. 

######  PR's welcome!

<h3>About IPA</h3>
 
IPA was made to make the average developers life a little easier, when wanting to create their own plugin for the Ionic framework. I've written Medium articles about how to do this manually, but I figured that It would make my life easier, just to create a package, that would help me with all of the initial setup, because despite writing about it, I still forget some of the steps.

## Install

First make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
(You may need to restart your computer after this step).

Install IPA From NPM:

    npm i -g ionic-plugin-assistant
    
## Usage

If you have installed IPA from npm, then from terminal in your project directory, run the command

    ipa

You'll then be prompted to answer a few questions about your plugin, such as:
1. It's name (e.g: image-picker)
2. A short plugin description 
3. Your name (Your github username is always a good choice).
4. The platforms you're targeting IOS, Android of Both!

Then you're all set.

## Ionic-Plugin-Assistant TODO:
- [x] Copy templates over with submitted information.
- [ ] Optimize project code.
- [ ] Create Unit Tests.
